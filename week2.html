          <h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>
          <p>
            - Paper prototyping is a quick, low-cost way to sketch out ideas
            before digital design.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Crazy Eights is a rapid ideation technique where you fold a paper
            into eight sections and sketch eight different design ideas in eight
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Wireframes are more structured, hand-drawn sketches that map out
            layouts and interactions.

          <h2>Designing for the Web</h2>
          <p>
            Web design involves creating visually appealing, user-friendly, and
            responsive websites. It includes considerations like typography,
            color schemes, layout, and accessibility.

            Loved the user experience — felt like a game. Enjoyed the
            visualisation of the songs and the way it’s categorised by size.
            Also loved that you can click and listen to the songs. The hover
            feature over every little dot added an extra layer of detail — so
            impressive!
