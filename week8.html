          <h2>LED’S Controlled by a Remote</h2>
          <p>
            We also tried building a project that used an IR sensor and a remote
            to control a row of LEDs. The idea was that pressing different
            buttons would light up different LEDs, which sounded fun and
            interactive. Even though it didn’t end up working during class, it
            gave me a basic understanding of how infrared communication works,
            like how remote controls send signals and how those get picked up by
            sensors. It was a bit tricky to troubleshoot, and we didn’t get the
            chance to finish it properly, but it showed me how many little parts
            need to work together for something to run smoothly.

          <h2>Capacitive Touch Sensors</h2>
          <p>
            We worked with capacitive touch sensors, which detect when your skin
            touches or comes close to a conductive material. They basically
            measure changes in electrical charge, so when you touch something
            like a grape, it triggers a response — in our case, it played a
            sound through a buzzer. We tested it with foil, leaves, and a grape.
            Only the grape worked, but that made it even more fun. It was so
            cool to see it actually make a noise when you touched it, and we
            even managed to play a basic song by tapping different inputs. It
            was a really fun and unexpected way to learn about interactivity,
            and it made me realise how physical computing doesn’t have to feel
            technical — it can be playful and weird and creative.

          <h2>Arduino and a potentiometer to control an LED light</h2>
          <p>
            The potentiometer let us change the brightness in real time, kind of
            like a dimmer switch. It was interesting to see how turning a knob
            could be translated into both code and electrical output. It made it
            really clear how analog input can control output in a physical way.
            This helped me understand how sensors and inputs work with hardware
            and software to create interactive experiences.

          <h2>Capacitive Sensor with a Buzzer</h2>
          <p>
            We worked with a capacitive sensor and a buzzer, where the buzzer
            would go off if someone was in close proximity to it. It was really
            interesting to see it react in real time, and it made me realise how
            much everyday technology works in a similar way. I also started to
            see how physical computing could be used creatively. Even something
            as simple as a buzzer could feel emotional or symbolic, depending on
            the context. It was fun to build, and even when it didn’t work at
            first, the hands-on trial and error helped everything make more
            sense.

            The Selfie Toaster:
          </p>
          <p>The Selfie Toaster is such a weird but funny idea. It lets you burn your own face onto a slice of bread, which is completely unnecessary but also kind of brilliant. I liked how it made something as ordinary as toast feel playful. It made me think about how far people are willing to go to customise everyday objects, and how design doesn’t always have to be practical to be memorable.</p>

            The Noodle Cooler:
          </p>
          <p>It’s a mini fan that clips onto chopsticks to cool your noodles as you eat. It’s completely over-the-top, but that’s what makes it so clever. It exaggerates a small everyday problem in such a dramatic way that you can’t help but pay attention. It reminded me that design can be theatrical and still make a point — sometimes pushing an idea too far is exactly what makes it stick.</p>

          <p>Touchable Memories by Lola Studios:</p>
          <p>
            Touchable Memories really touched me. I’m always drawn to sensitive, emotional projects like this, and I found the idea so beautiful. The fact that something as simple as a photo could be turned into a 3D object for someone to physically feel was so moving. It made me think about how powerful design can be when it focuses on connection and accessibility, rather than just innovation for the sake of it. I loved that it wasn’t about flashy tech — it was quiet, personal, and full of meaning. It reminded me why I love design in the first place.

          <p>Text Rain by Camille Utterback & Romy Achituv</p>
          <p>
            I really liked this project,  It’s such a poetic way to bring interaction into art. I loved how the falling letters would respond to your body, it felt playful and meaningful. You’re not just looking at the artwork, you’re in it, shaping it. It made me think about how interfaces can be emotional and immersive, not just functional. The idea that you could literally catch words with your body felt so symbolic — like your presence alone could shift language or meaning. I found it soft, thoughtful, and beautifully done.
