          <h2>Sketch 1: Anti-Chip Eater</h2>
          <p>
            The Anti-Chip Eater is a Chindōgu invention designed to stop you
            from eating chips — but in the most unnecessarily complicated way
            possible. It involves small fingertip gloves with blunt spikes. When
            you try to pick up a chip, the spikes crush it before it reaches
            your mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            This idea plays with the tension between temptation and
            self-control, especially around snack foods. Instead of relying on
            willpower, it turns your own fingers into the obstacle. It’s a
            literal, physical reminder to stop but it’s also funny and
            definetely not meant to be a real solution.

          <h2>Sketch 2: Septum Air Freshner</h2>
          <p>
            The Septum Air Freshener is a personal scent device that clips onto
            your septum like a nose ring. Its purpose is to make everything
            smell good,all the time. Whether you’re walking through garbage or
            public transport, this invention ensures your experience remains
            fragrant.
          </p>
          <p>
            This idea pushes the boundaries of wearable convenience, taking the
            idea of air fresheners from homes and cars to the most personal
            space possible… your face.
          </p>
          <p>
            I liked coming up with this because it plays with the idea of
            control and comfort — we’re always trying to fix things in our
            environment, and this takes that to the extreme. It’s funny, kind of
            useful, kind of embarrassing…

          <h2>Sketch 3: Spaghetti Twister</h2>
          <p>
            The Spaghetti Twister is a machine that spins your fork for you, so
            you get the perfect, mess-free mouthful of pasta every time. It’s
            meant to solve the “problem” of spaghetti being a little annoying to
            eat — but does so in the most over-engineered way possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea really stretches the concept of convenience. Sure, it helps
            avoid the mess of twisting spaghetti, but it probably creates even
            more work when it comes to setting it up and cleaning it. It kind of
            defeats its own purpose, which is exactly what makes it a Chindōgu.
          </p>
          <p>
            I liked this idea because it’s so impractical and tedious for such a
            simple task, it just feels really silly — but in a way that sticks.
            And honestly, I do hate the mess of getting that perfect pasta
            twist, so maybe it’s not completely useless.

          <h2>Arduino and a p5.js</h2>
          <p>
            We connected an Arduino and a p5.js sketch using serial
            communication. A potentiometer connected to the Arduino was used as
            an input device — as you twisted it, it changed the brightness and
            size of a circle displayed in the browser using p5.js.The Arduino
            sent a simplified value (between 0–255) over serial, which p5.js
            read in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was one of my first proper experiences seeing hardware and
            software interact smoothly. The connection between turning something
            physical and instantly seeing the screen respond made it feel really
            alive. It was exciting to build that feedback loop between physical
            input and digital output.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea itself was super simple — just changing the brightness and
            size of a circle — but it was a great intro to how serial
            communication actually works. I also thought it was cool that the
            setup allowed for two-way interaction, even if we didn’t end up
            using that part. It made me realise how this could be used in way
            more interactive projects.
          </p>
          <p>Code Snippet:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            let serial;
let dataIn = 0;
let isConnected = false;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  serial = new p5.SerialPort();

  serial.on('connected', () => print("Serial Connected"));
  serial.on('data', serialEvent);
  serial.on('open', () => print("Port open!"));
  serial.on('error', (err) => print("Serial error: ", err));
  serial.on('close', () => print("Port closed"));

  // Replace with your specific port name (or use serial.getPorts() to find)
  serial.open('/dev/tty.usbmodem123456'); // Update this line with your port
}

function draw() {
  let bg = map(dataIn, 0, 255, 0, 255);
  background(bg);
  
  fill(255 - bg, 100, 200);
  noStroke();
  let size = map(dataIn, 0, 255, 50, width);
  circle(width/2, height/2, size);
}

function serialEvent() {
  let raw = serial.readLine().trim();
  if (raw.length > 0) {
    dataIn = int(raw);
    print("Received: " + dataIn);
  }
}

// OPTIONAL: Send mouse position back to Arduino
function mouseMoved() {
  let xMapped = floor(map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 255));
  let yMapped = floor(map(mouseY, 0, height, 0, 255));
  let message = `${xMapped},${yMapped}\n`;
  serial.write(message);

          <h2>Potentiometer-Controlled Colour Display</h2>
          <p>
            The potentiometer let us change the brightness in real time, kind of
            like a dimmer switch. It was interesting to see how turning a knob
            could be translated into both code and electrical output. It made it
            really clear how analog input can control output in a physical way.
            This helped me understand how sensors and inputs work with hardware
            and software to create interactive experiences.

          <h2>Other Explorations</h2>
          <p>Final Project Brainstorming:</p>
          <p>Sentimirror</p>
          <p>
            Gunjan and I decided to team up and come up with an idea that
            incorporates both p5.js and interactive elements. We knew we wanted
            it to be an installation, and we both liked the idea of something
            poetic, emotional, and rooted in self-reflection.
          </p>
          <p>
            We brainstormed ways we wanted the experience to look and feel. We
            were drawn to the concept of self-reflection, both literally and
            figuratively. The idea was that a person would stand in front of a
            mirror, and the machine would read their emotional input and respond
            with a sensory output that is both visual and auditory.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were inspired by artworks we had found in the past weeks,
            especially We Feel Fine by Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar, and Text
            Rain by Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv. These pieces helped
            shape how we thought about emotion, language, and interaction in a
            digital space.

          <p>
            <p>Sentimirror is a web-based interactive artwork that visualises a user’s emotional state through colour, motion, and silhouette interaction.</p>
          <p>The experience begins with the user answering a poetic question, such as “What do you feel when you close your eyes?” Their written response is analysed using ML5.js sentiment analysis to detect the emotional tone as positive, neutral, or negative.</p>
         <p>Based on this input, the system generates emotion-driven visuals. Waves of colour shift in palette, speed, and behaviour depending on the detected mood. A webcam captures the user’s silhouette, allowing them to interact with the visuals using their body in real time.</p>
          <p>The result is a reflective and expressive experience that responds to a wide range of feelings, from calm and joyful to anxious or uncertain. It turns the user’s presence into a canvas for emotion.</p>

            <h2>Hunt n Gather:</h2>
          <p>The Strangers by Kyung Yun Choi</p>
          <p>
            The Stranger is an interactive installation that uses a vintage typewriter to turn your voice into Morse code except it intentionally leaves out words like “I” and “You.” It’s super poetic. The idea is to show how language can distance us from what we really mean, or even from ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>What stood out to me is how it uses something old and mechanical (Morse code + typewriter) to reflect on the disconnect we feel in modern communication. It’s like… you’re speaking, but your voice becomes something unrecognizable and impersonal. I l guess it makes you question whether we can ever truly say what we feel.</p>

          <p>
            I visited the Science Gallery and was in awe of this piece. GUÀI is this really cool interactive work that scans your face and links you to a mythical creature from ancient Chinese mythology. It honestly made me feel like I’d stepped into another realm — like I was being digitally transformed into something magical.
          </p>
          <p>The robotic AI was so surreal. It analysed your biometrics and matched you with a character, and you could even scan the creature and take a little card home with you, which was such a fun detail. What really stood out to me was how it combined something so ancient with something so futuristic — folklore and tech coming together to say something about identity.</p>

          <p>The Changing Room by Lauren McCarthy</p>
          <p>
            The Changing Room is an immersive installation that lets you pick an emotion, like “nostalgic” or “envious” and then transforms the entire space to reflect that feeling. It uses sensors to track your movement, facial expressions, and voice pitch, responding with visuals, sounds, and prompts to create this shared emotional atmosphere. It actually reminded me a lot of our final project, which I thought was super interesting and really inspiring.
          <p>
            What I love about installations like this is how they take something internal, something we usually keep to ourselves and make it physical and shared. It made me think about how our feelings aren’t always just ours alone. This piece turns emotion into something you can literally step into, and it made me reflect on how much our environment and the people around us can shape the way we feel
