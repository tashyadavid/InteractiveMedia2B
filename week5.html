          <h2>Paint an Image</h2>
          <p>
            In this sketch, I explored how an image can be used like a
            paintbrush in p5.js. As I moved the mouse across the canvas, the
            image would duplicate and follow the cursor, creating a trail of
            visual texture. It reminded me of digital stamping or
            collage-making, every movement left a mark that built up a
            composition over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used two images in this experiment. When the mouse is pressed, one
            image appears, and when it’s not, the other one is used. This simple
            switch made the interaction feel more dynamic and playful — almost
            like I was toggling between two brushes or layers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exercise taught me how versatile image() can be when used
            creatively. It also helped me understand how conditional statements
            (if/else) can be used to control interactivity.

          <h2>Text to Point</h2>
          <p>
            In this sketch, I used textToPoints() to break up the phrase Les
            Points into individual coordinates and drew circles at each point.
            As the mouse moves across the screen, the size of the circles
            changes. This gave the text a dynamic, pulsing feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            It actually inspired the way I approached interactivity on my
            homepage, specifically how I mapped mouse position to control the
            volume of sound. I liked how subtle cursor movement could change the
            experience in real time.

          <h2>Webcam Experiment</h2>
          <p>
            I played around with how a webcam could be used to add fun
            interactivity. Instead of just showing the live feed, I added a
            posterize filter to give it a more stylised, graphic look, kind of
            like a digital stencil effect. I later incorporated this idea into
            my homepage to make the experience feel more personal and playful.

            This was another fun experiment using one of the code snippets from
            the week 5 module. I didn’t change much, but just playing around
            with it showed me how even a super simple sketch can add personality
            to a webpage. It tracks your mouse and adds a counter every time you
            press a key, it really brings the screen to life in a fun way.

            Blokdust was such a fun experience. I love that every interaction
            feels unique—the outcome is never exactly the same. It gives the
            user so much creative freedom, and the interface makes it really
            easy to experiment. The graphics are super cool, and I really like
            the way all the elements fit and sit together on the screen. It
            feels playful, intuitive, and just really satisfying to use.

            Computer-generated images have a certain aesthetic to them that
            makes them immediately recognizable as such by the trained eye.”
            Mathias Dörfelt uses programming to generate unique, expressive
            faces that look like hand-drawn illustrations. I really love this
            because I’m drawn to line art and quirky, character-filled drawings.
            I didn’t realize it was possible to create so much personality and
            variation in faces through code. It’s such a cool mix of technical
            and artistic creativity.
