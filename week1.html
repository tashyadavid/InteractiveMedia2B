        <p>
          High-tech artworks often serve as a means of promoting new
          technologies, which may be a concern for communicators who prioritize
          meaning and context in their work. The writer remains skeptical of the
          consumer-driven excitement surrounding information technology and
          challenges the idea of the frequent upgrade cycle.
