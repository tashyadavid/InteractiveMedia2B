        <h1>Week 6</h1>
        <h2>Data in your Pocket</h2>
        <p>
          This was a group activity where we explored different ways of
          visualising data. We began by emptying the contents of our bags and,
          as a group, came up with a unique way to categorise the items. We
          decided to sort them based on “how long we’d spend looking for the
          item if we lost it.” The items were arranged in a circular pattern,
          with the most important things placed at the center and the less
          important ones radiating outward.
        </p>
        <p>
          What made this activity really fun was realising just how many things
          we all carry around without noticing. It also sparked some deeper
          thinking: how many mundane things in our lives could be re-categorised
          or reframed to tell a story? This experience made me appreciate how
          even ordinary objects can gain meaning when viewed through a different
          lens.

        <h2>Data Visualisation Pie-Chart</h2>
        <p>
          I created this pie chart as a simple example of data visualisation
          using p5.js. It shows how much storage I’m using across my most-used
          devices and platforms: my laptop, mobile, Google Drive, and iCloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          To build the chart, I used a for loop to calculate the proportion of
          each item and render it as a slice of the circle. I also added a
          color-coded legend to make the data easier to read. Each section of
          the pie represents the amount of storage used on that device or
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a fun way to visually reflect on just how much digital space I
          occupy. This activity also helped me understand how to break data into
          parts and represent it proportionally.

        <h2>Dance Snippet</h2>
        <p>
          This sketch turns sound into movement using p5.js and the p5.Sound
          library. A circle and the word “DANCE” react to the volume of a
          looping audio track — growing, rotating, and following the mouse based
          on sound input. The random “DANCE NOW” button adds a playful,
          energetic touch. This was a fun way to explore sound as data and use
          it to create interactive, expressive visuals.

        <h2>Hunt n Gather</h2>
        <p>Population By Pixel:</p>
        <p>
          Population by Pixel campaign is a powerful example of data
          visualization used for emotional impact. Each image shows an
          endangered species, but instead of smooth gradients or high-res
          detail, the photo is made up of individual pixels—each one
          representing a single animal left in the wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought it was such a powerful way to turn numbers into something
          you can feel. Seeing just a handful of pixels make up an entire animal
          is impactful. It shows how creative data visualization can make you
          care, not just understand.

        <p>Eat the Rich:</p>
        <p>
          1 Pixel Wealth was such a crazy yet simple way to show the scale of
          wealth inequality. I love how it’s literally just pixels and names,
          but it says so much. I like that it doesn’t over-explain anything-it
          just lets the scroll do the talking. The fact that the scrolling
          literally never ends really puts things into perspective for me.

        <p>Dear Data:</p>

          Dear Data changed the way I think about data visualization. I love how
          Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec turned something so analytical into
          something emotional and hand drawn. I like the idea that data doesn’t
          have to be digital or polished, it can be messy, expressive, and full
          of feeling. I also liked how each week’s topic became such a unique
          form of reflection.
