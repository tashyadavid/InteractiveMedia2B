              <h2>Arduino Kit</h2>
              <p>
                This week we explored Arduino and learned about all the
                components in the Arduino kit, what each one is used for, and
                different ways to use them. It was interesting to see how far
                physical computing could actually go. One of the Telstra Space
                members showed us his project called Moth to the Flame, which
                was so cool to see. It was really poetic and so intricate, and
                it was interesting to see what was possible with physical
                computing.

              <h2>Using Arduino to Power an LED Light</h2>
              <p>
                This was one of the first circuits we built using just the
                Arduino as a power source, without writing any code. It was a
                simple setup with a button, resistor, and LED, but it helped me
                understand how electricity flows through a circuit. Pressing the
                button completed the circuit and lit up the LED, which made the
                whole thing feel really hands-on and physical. It was a good way
                to start thinking about how input and output works, even before
                introducing code. I realised how important it is to understand
                the hardware side, not just the programming.

              <h2>Arduino and a potentiometer to control an LED light</h2>
              <p>
                The potentiometer let us change the brightness in real time,
                kind of like a dimmer switch. It was interesting to see how
                turning a knob could be translated into both code and electrical
                output. It made it really clear how analog input can control
                output in a physical way. This helped me understand how sensors
                and inputs work with hardware and software to create interactive
                experiences.

              <h2>Ultrasonic Sensor with a Buzzer</h2>
              <p>
                We worked with an ultrasonic distance sensor and a buzzer, where
                the buzzer would go off if someone was in close proximity. It
                was really interesting to see it react in real time, and it made
                me realise how much everyday technology works in a similar way.
                I also started to see how physical computing could be used
                creatively. Even something as simple as a buzzer could feel
                emotional or symbolic, depending on the context. It was fun to
                build, and even when it didn’t work at first, the hands-on trial
                and error helped everything make more sense.

              <h2>Other Explorations</h2>
              <p>Overstimulated:</p>
              <p>
                I was inspired by how the ultrasonic sensor and buzzer worked
                together in class. It sparked the idea for an art piece I call
                <em>“Overstimulated.”</em> As the user approaches the sensor,
                the installation would emit an increasingly loud and repetitive
                beeping sound. It would continue until the user steps away. This
                could be enhanced with flashing lights or overwhelming visuals
                to evoke the intense, often chaotic feeling of being
                overstimulated— especially in crowded or socially intense
                environments. The goal is to create an experience that makes the
                emotional state physically and sensorially tangible.

                I thought it was such a powerful way to turn numbers into
                something you can feel. Seeing just a handful of pixels make up
                an entire animal is impactful. It shows how creative data
                visualization can make you care, not just understand.

              <p>Can’t Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu:</p>
              <p>
                Can’t Help Myself was so unsettling but also weirdly
                captivating. Watching the robotic arm constantly try to contain
                the red liquid felt like watching something painfully human. It
                was stuck in this endless loop of cleaning up its own mess. It
                made me think about control, failure, and how exhausting it is
                to try and keep everything together. Even though it’s just a
                machine, it almost felt alive. I like how physical computing was
                used to create something so emotional, something that made
                people stop and actually feel something.

                This was an interesting piece because it looks so simple at
                first, but it draws you in as you realise what it’s actually
                doing. It auto-generates and prints out the details of murders
                happening in Venezuela every 20 minutes. It made the violence
                feel constant and mechanical, like it had become so normalised.
                The idea to make the machine feed receipts was also really
                powerful. It made the information feel disposable, which says a
                lot about how numb people have become to tragedy. The whole
                piece really stuck with me.
