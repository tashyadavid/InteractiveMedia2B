        <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive design ensures that websites adapt smoothly to different
          screen sizes and devices. This is achieved using flexible layouts,
          fluid images, and CSS techniques like media queries. The goal is to
          create a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile
          devices.

          The entire body of scientific and cultural knowledge published in
          books and journals is increasingly being digitized and restricted by
          private corporations. This challenges the idea that nothing can be
          done about it and emphasizes the importance of free access to
          information. It also highlights the unacceptable inequalities between
          communities that have access and those that do not.

          The poor image is a low-resolution, widely circulated copy that loses
          quality as it spreads but gains accessibility. It challenges the
          hierarchy of high-resolution media, allowing marginalized content to
          be seen despite commercialization and digital degradation.
